Simulations for Robin Hanson's mathematical model of aggressive alien expansion

So far, I've managed to replicate his basic simulations from his blog post: https://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/12/how-far-aggressive-aliens-part-2.html

Check out the `replicating-hansons-sims.ipynb` notebook to see how I replicated his figure! This was a fun and fairly straightforward exercise.
